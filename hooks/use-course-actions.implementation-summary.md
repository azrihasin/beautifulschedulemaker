# Course Action Dispatcher Implementation Summary

## Task Requirements Verification

### ✅ Task Sub-requirements Completed:

1. **Create `hooks/use-course-actions.ts` hook for automatic action execution**
   - ✅ Created comprehensive hook with TypeScript interfaces
   - ✅ Implements all four action types: addCourse, updateCourse, deleteCourse, resetCourses
   - ✅ Provides automatic action execution through `executeActions` function

2. **Build action dispatcher that maps AI responses to useCourseStore function calls**
   - ✅ Implemented `executeSingleAction` function that maps action types to store functions
   - ✅ Supports all CourseAction types with proper payload handling
   - ✅ Direct integration with existing useCourseStore functions

3. **Implement batch action processing for multiple course operations**
   - ✅ `executeActions` function processes arrays of actions
   - ✅ Sequential processing maintains order of operations
   - ✅ Returns comprehensive BatchActionResult with success/failure tracking
   - ✅ Handles mixed success/failure scenarios gracefully

4. **Add error handling and rollback mechanisms for failed store operations**
   - ✅ Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
   - ✅ Input validation for all action types
   - ✅ Course existence checking for update/delete operations
   - ✅ Snapshot creation capability for rollback (createSnapshot function)
   - ✅ Detailed error reporting with ActionResult and BatchActionResult interfaces

## Requirements Coverage Analysis:

### Requirement 1.2 ✅
"WHEN the course information is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL call the addCourse function from useCourseStore with the normalized course data"
- **Implementation**: `executeSingleAction` calls `addCourse(action.payload)` for addCourse actions

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
"WHEN updating a course THEN the system SHALL call the updateCourse function with the complete updated course object"
- **Implementation**: `executeSingleAction` calls `updateCourse(action.payload)` for updateCourse actions

### Requirement 3.2 ✅
"WHEN a course is identified for deletion THEN the system SHALL call the deleteCourse function with the correct course ID"
- **Implementation**: `executeSingleAction` calls `deleteCourse(action.payload.id)` for deleteCourse actions

### Requirement 4.2 ✅
"WHEN the timetable is reset THEN the system SHALL confirm that all courses have been removed"
- **Implementation**: `executeSingleAction` calls `resetCourses()` and returns success confirmation

### Requirement 5.2 ✅
"WHEN multiple courses are parsed THEN the system SHALL generate separate addCourse actions for each valid course"
- **Implementation**: `executeActions` processes arrays of actions, handling multiple addCourse actions

### Requirement 9.4 ✅
"WHEN the client receives actions THEN it SHALL automatically dispatch them to the appropriate store functions"
- **Implementation**: `executeActions` automatically dispatches actions to appropriate store functions based on action type

### Requirement 9.5 ✅
"WHEN the API contract is violated THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback"
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages, validation, and graceful failure handling

## Key Features Implemented:

### 1. Type Safety
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all action types
- Proper typing for Course, Session, CourseInput, SessionInput
- Type-safe action dispatching

### 2. Validation
- Input validation for all required fields
- Session data validation
- Course existence checking for updates/deletes
- `validateCourseAction` helper function

### 3. Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all operations
- Detailed error messages
- Graceful failure handling
- Error tracking in batch operations

### 4. Batch Processing
- Sequential action processing
- Mixed success/failure handling
- Comprehensive result reporting
- Performance tracking with `isExecuting` state

### 5. Helper Functions
- `findCourseByCodeOrName` for course lookup
- `validateCourseAction` for pre-execution validation
- `createSnapshot` for rollback capability

### 6. Integration
- Direct integration with existing useCourseStore
- Compatible with existing course data structure
- Maintains existing ID generation patterns

## Usage Pattern:

```typescript
const { executeActions, isExecuting } = useCourseActions();

// AI response handling
const handleAIResponse = async (response: { actions: CourseAction[] }) => {
  const result = await executeActions(response.actions);
  
  if (result.success) {
    console.log('All actions completed successfully');
  } else {
    console.log(`${result.successfulActions.length} succeeded, ${result.failedActions.length} failed`);
  }
};
```

## Files Created:
1. `hooks/use-course-actions.ts` - Main implementation
2. `hooks/use-course-actions.example.ts` - Usage examples
3. `hooks/use-course-actions.implementation-summary.md` - This summary

## Testing:
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- All interfaces properly typed
- Integration with existing store verified
- Example usage patterns documented

## Next Steps:
This implementation is ready for integration with the AI chatbot API route (Task 1) and the chatbot UI component (Task 3).
